# Portage overlay for HS apps

This is a [Portage overlay][overlay] to install apps from [Hardcoded Software][hs].

It's a work in progress and isn't really ready for actual usage yet.

## Install

1. Clone this repo somewhere.
2. Add this `<somewhere>` to your `PORTDIR_OVERLAY` in `/etc/portage/make.conf`.
3. Try `emerge moneyguru`. With some luck, it will work.
